        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Mr.Muhammad Ali's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> - Born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1954</strong> - He began training as an amateur boxer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1960</strong> -  He won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional later that year.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1961</strong> - He converted to islam.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1964</strong> - He won the world heavyweight championship, defeating Sonny Liston in a major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1964</strong> - He denounced his birth name as a "slave name" and formally changed his name to Muhammad Ali.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1966</strong> - Ali refused to be drafted into the military owing to his religious beliefs and ethical opposition to the Vietnam War and was found guilty of draft evasion and stripped of his boxing titles. He stayed out of prison while appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, where his conviction was overturned in 1971. <strong>He did not fight for nearly four years</strong> and lost a period of peak performance as an athlete. Ali's actions as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War made him an icon for the larger counterculture of the 1960s generation, and he was a very high-profile figure of racial pride for African Americans during the civil rights movement and throughout his career.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1964-1970</strong> - He held the Ring magazine heavyweight title from 1964 to 1970.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1984</strong> - Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's syndrome, which sometimes results from head trauma from violent physical activities such as boxing.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1998</strong> -  Ali began working with actor Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson's disease, to raise awareness and fund research for a cure.</li>
          <li>

          <li>
            <strong>2016</strong> - Ali was hospitalized in Scottsdale, Arizona, on June 2, 2016, with a respiratory illness. Though his condition was initially described as fair, it worsened, and he died the following day at the age of 74 from septic shock.
